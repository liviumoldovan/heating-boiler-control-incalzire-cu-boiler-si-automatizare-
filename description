ESPHome Configuration Summary

This ESPHome configuration file defines a control unit based on an ESP32 device for a heating or domestic hot water system.
It implements complex automation logic that includes temperature reading, time-based control, and safety/manual override functions.

üõ†Ô∏è System Overview
The system reads three temperatures from a One-Wire (DS18B20) bus and controls two Solid State Relays (SSRs),
which are automatically managed every 3 seconds, with the option for manual intervention.

üå°Ô∏è Temperature Sensors (Measurements)Temperatura Tur Apa Calda (Hot Water Flow Temperature - temp_tur): 
Likely the temperature in the boiler/tank.Temperatura Retur Apa Calda (Hot Water Return Temperature - temp_retur): 
The temperature of the water returning to the heat source.Temperatura Ambientala (Ambient Temperature - temp_ambient): 
The temperature in the living space.

üí° Actuators
(Control)SSR Ambient (ssr_ambient, on GPIO25):
Most likely controls a circulation pump or a heating element for the ambient/room circuit.
SSR Zi (10-16) (Daytime SSR - ssr_solar, on GPIO26): Most likely controls a heating element (resistor) for the domestic hot water boiler,
activated during the day.

‚öôÔ∏è Automation Logic
(Executed every 3s)The automation logic only runs if the manual control or Emergency Stop function is not active.

1. Control of the SSR Zi (Boiler)This SSR controls the heating of the water in the boiler (or the solar backup element).
Turn ON: It is turned ON if two conditions are met:It is within the time interval 10:00 AM - 3:59 PM (daytime).
The Hot Water Flow Temperature (temp_tur) is below $75^\circ C$ (a safety condition to prevent overheating).
Turn OFF: It is turned OFF if it is outside the specified time window or if the flow temperature reaches/exceeds $75^\circ C$.

2. Control of the SSR AmbientThis SSR controls the heating of the ambient space (e.g., turning on a pump or a heating resistance for radiators/underfloor heating).
Turn ON: It is turned ON if three conditions are met:The Ambient Temperature (temp_ambient) is below $22^\circ C$ (heat is needed).
The Hot Water Return Temperature (temp_retur) is below $60^\circ C$ (to avoid using agent that is too hot or to protect the system).
The Daytime SSR (Boiler) is ON (is_boiler_on is true), suggesting a functional dependency ‚Äì ambient heating is only 
allowed if the boiler system is also active/running.Turn OFF: It is turned OFF if any of the above conditions are not met.

üö® Override and Safety Functions
1. Emergency Stop (New)An Oprire de Urgenta (Emergency Stop) template switch immediately turns OFF both SSRs (ssr_ambient and ssr_solar) when activated,
   regardless of the automation or sensor status. 
   When deactivated, the automation resumes control.
2. Temporary Manual ControlTwo template switches (SSR Ambient Manual, SSR Zi Manual) allow forcing each SSR ON.
   These manual commands are temporary: once activated, they keep the corresponding SSR ON for 10 minutes, after which they
   automatically turn OFF, allowing the automation logic to take back control.
   The ESPHome automation precisely controls two Solid State Relays (SSRs)‚Äîone for ambient heating/circulation (ssr_ambient) and
   one for daytime domestic hot water/boiler heating (ssr_solar)‚Äîbased on temperature readings and time.
   Here is exactly how each SSR is controlled, with the logic executed every 3 seconds:1. Control of SSR Zi (10-16) (Daytime Boiler/DHW)This SSR (on GPIO26) is designed to heat the domestic hot water during a specific daytime window.Control StateConditions for Turn ON (AND)Conditions for Turn OFF (OR)ON1. Time: It is between 10:00 AM and 3:59 PM. 2. Safety: The Hot Water Flow Temperature (temp_tur) is below $75^\circ C$ (to prevent boiler overheating).It is not within the specified time range (10-16) OR the Hot Water Flow Temperature reaches or exceeds $75^\circ C$.Override ConditionIf the SSR Zi Manual switch is ON (temporary manual control) OR if the emergency_stop switch is ON, the automatic logic DOES NOT RUN.2. Control of SSR Ambient (Pump/Circulation)This SSR (on GPIO25) is designed to activate the ambient space heating, and is dependent on the boiler system running.Control StateConditions for Turn ON (AND)Conditions for Turn OFF (OR)ON1. Heat Demand: The Ambient Temperature (temp_ambient) is below $22^\circ C$. 2. Return OK: The Hot Water Return Temperature (temp_retur) is below $60^\circ C$ (an internal system limit). 3. Boiler Active: The SSR Zi (10-16) is ALREADY ON (i.e., there is an active heat source).Any of the three turn-on conditions IS NOT met.Override ConditionIf the SSR Ambient Manual switch is ON (temporary manual control) OR if the emergency_stop switch is ON, the automatic logic DOES NOT RUN.

üö® Manual and Emergency ControlA.
Temporary Manual Control (ssr_ambient_manual, ssr_solar_manual)
If either of these template switches is turned ON (e.g., from Home Assistant), it forces the corresponding SSR ON.
After 10 minutes (delay: 10min), the manual switch automatically turns OFF (switch.turn_off), returning control to the automatic logic described above.B.
Emergency Stop (emergency_stop)When this switch is ON, it immediately turns OFF both SSRs (ssr_ambient and ssr_solar) and blocks the automatic logic from turning them back ON.
When it is OFF, the automation resumes control.
