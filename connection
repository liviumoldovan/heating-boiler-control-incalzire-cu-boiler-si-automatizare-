The ESP32 device uses the following pins (GPIOs):

GPIO4: Used for the One-Wire bus to which the three temperature sensors (Dallas DS18B20) are connected.

GPIO25: Used to control the SSR Ambient (Solid State Relay for ambient heating/pump).

GPIO26: Used to control the SSR Zi (10-16) (Solid State Relay for daytime boiler heating).

VIN 5V power for SSR

Having placed a 4.7k resistor between the data pin (GPIO4) and the 3.3v supply ensures reliable One-Wire communication for reading your temperatures.
